Notes is a web app that I cam currently developing using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The premise of Notes is to allow users to write down ideas on a "note" and save it, similar to many other note taking apps. The site is hosting using Firebase. I decided to use Firebase as it would allow me to host the site, and implement user authentication, and to test it out for the first time as I had not used it before.

My main goal with Notes, was to further develop my HTML, CSS/Sass, and HTML skills while also learning something new in Firebase. Creating Notes also exposed me to problems such as mapping out a site's pages. Currently, Notes does not support User Authentication, however you can test the app as a Guest which does not allow you to save the notes you create.

Notes is still in development, here are some of the things I hope to accomplish:
 - Create sign-up page
 - User authentication
 - Save Functionality
 - Display the users Notes in the left hand menu
 - Add Custimisation options like different colour themes, font size, etc.
 - Create Custom 404 page
